# Faker GUI (Graphical User Interface)

Faker GUI is a Web that generates fake data for you. Whether you need to bootstrap your database, create good-looking XML documents, fill-in your persistence to stress test it, or anonymize data taken from a production service, Faker is for you.

- Simple & Modern.
- See HTML, CSS & Javascript and PHP in the right.
- ✨ Magic ✨

## Features

- Supported with JSON and GUI.
- Can take a locale as an argument, to return localized data. If no localized provider is found, the factory fallbacks to the default locale (en_US). You can check available Faker locales in the source code, [under the Provider directory](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker/tree/master/src/Faker/Provider).
